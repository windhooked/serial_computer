Learning by doing, the journey of building a serial computer
 
After watching Usagi Electric's Bendix G15 restoration on youtube. 

Maybe it is time to build a simple serial machine, for starters to calcuate Pi and display digits on a nixie tube display. Make it programmable.

Looks like using Zuse Z1 adder might be a good start :)
